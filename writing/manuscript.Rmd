# Abstract



# Introduction

<!-- - central question -->
How does temperature affect the movement rates of mammals in BC? How will mammals move differently in the next century in response to climate change?

<!-- - relevance of the question -->
Estimating the movement rates of mammals allows us to quantify: (1) changes in mammals' energetic expenditures due to changes in movement, (2) changes in human-wildlife conflict due to changes in activity rates.

<!-- - address any questions answered in the discussion -->


# Methods

<!-- - data needed -->
mammals' GPS location data, mammals' speeds, historical weather data, climate change projections

<!-- - methods and analyses -->


<!-- - how data were obtained -->


# Results

<!-- - show main trends -->

# Discussion

<!-- - how results answer central question -->


<!-- - what it tells us about the broader field -->


<!-- - address any questions presented in the discussion -->
